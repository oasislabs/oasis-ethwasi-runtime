# Determines the correct docker tag to use
# based on the current git branch/tag.
# This tag is saved as metadata in the buildkite
# pipeline so that it can be retrieved in steps
# that want to pull the same exact image from
# Docker Hub.
#
# This tag value must be calculated once and saved
# as metadata in buildkite because it is possible
# that the tag name includes a timestamp, which could
# obviously change if the tag were recalculated.
#
# This script is intended to have buildkite
# specific things, like env vars and calling
# the buildkite-agent binary. Keeping this
# separate from the generic script that gets
# called allows us to use and test the generic
# scripts easily on a local dev box.
